In the late 13th century, the renowned mathematician name missing lay on his deathbed. Before his passing, he decided to leave a cryptic message on his grave, an enigmatic sequence of numbers. These numbers appeared to be unrelated, lacking the characteristic pattern.

As time went by, mathematicians and scholars puzzled over these seemingly random numbers, attempting to decipher their meaning. It became a mathematical mystery, a challenge to uncover the hidden message left by the brilliant mind of a mysterious person. Despite numerous attempts, the code remained unbroken.

To this day, the numbers on the grave of this mysterious person continue to perplex and intrigue those who come across them, a testament to the enduring legacy of a mathematical genius who left a final puzzle for the world to unravel.

Meet Bajtek, the coding virtuoso at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. After a wild night of celebrating a successful compile, fueled by too much caffene (and probably something stronger) Bajtek awoke with a colossal hangover. The room echoed with the triumphant cheers of his algorithms from the night before, but there was one tiny hiccup‚Äîhe couldn't remember his password.

In the last programming session, Bajtek unleashed a coding catastrophe ‚Äì his spaghetti code was so messy that even the compiler threw up its hands in surrender. Colleagues attempted to debug it, but the code was like a Rubik's Cube on a caffeine overdose. Bajtek proudly declared it an avant-garde programming masterpiece, leaving his coworkers wondering if they should call a programmer's version of an exorcist. In the end, they renamed his file "spaghetti.cpp" to "noodleNightmare.cpp" as a memorial to the chaotic session.
