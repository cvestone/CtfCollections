For every move you play, Black gets two! Stockfish plays against you!

Really straight forward, survive 50 moves, you win.

You can get your Italians ready by 1. e2e4 or play Queen's Gambit with 1. d2d4

I played 1. d2d4 then 2. c2c4 then 3. d1d4 and lost my Queen :'(

Good luck to you though!

The flag format is UofTCTF{AIRPORT_AIRLINE_AIRCRAFT}. AIRPORT is the 3 letter IATA code, AIRLINE is the name of the airline (dash-separated if required), and AIRCRAFT is the aircraft model and variant (omit manufacturer name). For example, UofTCTF{YYZ_Air-Canada_A320-200} or UofTCTF{YYZ_Delta_767-300}.

Note: The aircraft variant should be of X00 format; ie. there may be models with XYZ-432, but the accepted variant will be XYZ-400.

Found one new 0 day, what a magic

This is an LPE(Local Privilege Escalation) challenge. Your task is to pop a highly-privileged(`nt authority\\system`) cmd.exe as a low-privileged user. Follow these steps to deploy the challenge locally:  

1. download and install the virtual machine from: [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)  
2. execute the installer (installer.exe in the attachment) as Administrator  
3. the installer will set up the vulnerable component. You can then attempt to find the vulnerability and exploit it  

Notes about the demo:  
1. Send your `exploit archive file` to demo@realworldctf.com and DM @M4x on Discord when you're ready. Meanwhile, the email should also contains your team name and team token  
2. You can choose to demo your exploit publicly or privately, according to your preference. If you choose to demo publicly, the entire process will be visible to everyone, so remember to remove sensitive information. If you choose to demo privately, we will set up a private discord channel that only includes the admin and your team members  
3. Our demo VM is slightly configured, including:  
   a. Windows Defender is disabled. You don't have to contend with it.  
   b. A standard user(not in the Administrator group, with the username being `ctf`) is created for demo purposes. We will run your exploit in the context of the standard user.  
4. If your exploit needs multiple steps, please batch them in a single file. We will only execute one of your files and then wait for the result without more user interaction  

I will not accept more than 3 emails per team. If you really need more, you will need to explain to me in detail why you messed up your first 3 tries and convince me that you deserve a 4th chance.   
The running time for each try cannot exceed 3 minutes.  

I will reward you with the flag if the highly-privileged cmd.exe pops up.

`score:500` `solve_count:0`

`Web`, `Clone-and-Pwn`, `difficulty:Schr\u00f6dinger`  

Welcome, seekers of cyber lore,  
To a challenge like none before.  
In a world where maps are key,  
GeoServer's the tool, you see.  

It's set on Windows, standing tall,  
With Tomcat running, serving all.  
But lurking deep, a bug does hide,  
An RCE gap, wide and wide.  

Your mission, should you choose to play,  
Is to exploit in a clever way.  
Use your skills, be sharp and keen,  
In the code, where not easily seen.  

Find the flaw, make your move,  
Let your savvy cyber groove  
Turn the tide, and gain control,  
In this digital escapade role.  

So embark on this virtual quest,  
Put your hacking skills to the test.  
In this GeoServer jive,  
Find the hive where RCEs thrive.  

Can you dive into the code,  
On this cyber treasure road,  
And emerge, with flags in hand,  
As the finest hacker in the land?

Hints 1:
 - First of ALL: for the expected solution, you MUST following the README.txt file to deploy the geoserver.
 - The expected solution is a combined Pre-auth RCE vulnerability of stable version of geoserver at 2.24.1 (just found that geoserver lastest released version 2.24.2, don't worry, it's is also vulnerable to expected solution), in more detail, it's an pre-auth vulnerability combined with post-auth RCE vulnerability.
 - For the pre-auth vulnerability, your mission is to find an 'abitrary file read' vuln (not a really 'abitrary', but is sufficient for you to obtain admin's privilege), after then, you can seek for post-auth RCE on geoserver 2.24.1 or geoserver 2.24.2 if you want ;)
 - The deployed machine is in an isolated network therefore it is not vulnerable to any oob attacks.

`Web`, `Pwn`, `difficulty:Schr√∂dinger`

> You sent a nightmail in the moon's pale glare,
> Then in my slumber, nightmares came to snare.

About the challenge:

* Environment setup: You can use the software installation package provided in the attachment to build a local environment for test. You can follow the default steps during installation, except for the `Set up encryption` step, you should choose `Continue without encryption` option.

* Find the vulnerability: Try to find a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in eM Client installed in Windows, the vulnerability should be triggered when the victim clicks the malicious email sent by you.

* Capture the flag: After your exploit successfully works in your local environment, you can connect to `nc 47.89.252.163:1337` to apply for your team's independent vm environment and then try to obtain the flag.

About the vm:

* OS: Windows Server 2022 x64
* Software version: eM Client v9.2.2157
* Path to flag: `C:\\flag`
* After the vm starts, an automated script will simulate logging into eM Client with the victim email address. After waiting for 5 minutes, it will click on the most recent email in the inbox.
* The vm will be destroyed after 15 minutes.
* If you are sure that your exploit can work locally but keeps failing in the remote vm environment, please contact me (@voidfyoo) on discord channel.

#### spellbound

(adj.) spell‚Ä¢bound (spel'bound') : held by or as if by a spell.

Submit your APK here: [spellbound.mc.ax](https://spellbound.mc.ax/)

The evaluation process is as follows. A fresh Android emulator is started using the Docker image `us-docker.pkg.dev/android-emulator-268719/images/30-google-x64:30.1.2` and the DictionaryService, DictionaryApp, and your APK are installed. It then launches your APK with the command `am start -n com.dicectf2024.attackerapp/com.dicectf2024.attackerapp.MainActivity` waits for 20 seconds, and then returns you the output of `logcat -d dicectf:V *:S` Make sure you sign your APK, or else it will not install.

Your goal is to access the random flag generated by the DictionaryService, and log it to logcat so that you can see the random flag. Then, **exchange** that flag for a real flag using the "get flag" page. The random flag is different for every submission. You must submit the correct random flag generated for that submission in order to get the real flag.

**DO NOT** attack anything outside of the Android emulator. This includes the CTF infrastructure, the UI for submitting APKs, viewing the results, etc. Also, the Android emulator does not have any network access. This is purely an Android challenge.

#### floordrop
hpmv, orion     8 solves / 362 points

Ever heard of airdrops? Well, we're doing a floordrop. We're dropping the flag on the floor. Go pick it up.

This challenge happens on DiceChain, an Ethereum-compatible network started using go-ethereum with the genesis.json provided to you. You may start a challenge attempt at any time by connecting to the provided nc.

During each challenge attempt,

- The server will generate a challenge for you to solve and send a transaction that calls `setChallenge(the challenge)` on the ProofOfWork contract.
- Two seconds later, the server will send another transaction that calls `expireChallenge()` on the same contract.
- Your goal is to solve the challenge and submit the solution by calling `solveChallenge(the solution encoded in bigendian bytes, random nonce)`, before the challenge expires. A script to solve the challenge has been provided to you in `solve.py`.
- If you submit the correct solution before the challenge expires, a flag will be printed in the same nc session.
You're encouraged to use the mock challenge (menu option 1) to familiarize yourself with the challenge setup. Also, to help with your understanding, an example series of transactions that would yield a successful solve can be found in block [154](https://floordrop.hpmv.dev/block/154).

AI meets cryptography! DiceNet is a cutting-edge flag checker which leverages multi-party computation to perform secure inference.

There is a bug in the construction described in the papers (see README.txt), which is implemented by swanky. You do not need to comb through the library's code to find the bug. Read the papers!

Hint: what happens when you use a composite modulus?

Super wide roads with trains... Is this the new Dallas? Flag format: uiuctf{coordinates of intersection between the rail and the road} Example: uiuctf{41.847, -87.626}

Flag format clarification: Use three decimal points of precision, truncate, and do not round. Use Google Maps location for reference. The last digit of the first cooordinate is odd, and the last digit of the second coordinate is even.

Now that's a BIG plane! I wonder where it is. Flag format: uiuctf{plane type, coordinates of the aircraft} Example: uiuctf{Airbus A380-800, 40.036, -88.264}

For coordinates, just omit the digits, do not round up. Precision is the same as the one in the example. The aircraft name is the same as Wikipedia page title. You can extract enough information from this image to answer this. You DO NOT need to register any accounts, all the information is public.

Flag format clarification: The last digit of the first coordinate is even, and the last digit of the second coordinate is odd.

Welcome to Emoji Stack, the brand new stack based emoji language! Instead of other stack based turing machines that use difficult to read and challenging characters like + - and [], Emoji Stack uses our proprietary patent pending emoji system.

#### Emoji Stack V2
Medium ‰∏≠Á≠â
Back by popular demand, V2 of EmojiStack is ready to release! Following user feedback, we've made some changes to how things work:
Â∫îÂ§ß‰ºóÈúÄÊ±ÇÔºåEmojiStack V2 Â∑≤ÂáÜÂ§áÂ•ΩÂèëÂ∏ÉÔºÅÊ†πÊçÆÁî®Êà∑ÂèçÈ¶àÔºåÊàë‰ª¨ÂØπËøê‰ΩúÊñπÂºèËøõË°å‰∫Ü‰∏Ä‰∫õÊõ¥ÊîπÔºö

It was pointed out that EmojiStack wasn't actually turing complete, and was instead just "A really dumb markup language." To remedy this, we've added three new commands for execution control, please see details below. Sticking with our philosophy of readability, we figured that hex numbers are too complicated and have decided to switch to easily read emoji representations. Numbers will now be encoded in base 12 from üïõ to üïö. Example: üîÅ5f --> üîÅüïõüïñüïö For our second release, it only seemed fair to add a second stack dimension! Emoji Stack now supports a 255x255 grid of cells. With the addition of two dimensional stacks, a good idea fairy said it might be cool to represent stack states using images. The state of the stack is now saved as a 255x255 8 bit grey scale image to allow for the pre-initialization of the stack. Images are stored raster-scan order with 0,0 being the top left of the image.

#### Not another vm reversing problem
Medium ‰∏≠Á≠â
You find yourself locked out of a mysterious terminal in an underground lair that‚Äôs rumored to hold the key to a treasure of unimaginable value: the flag. The terminal is powered by an ancient, quirky virtual machine that hasn't been updated since the days of dial-up internet. Your task is simple... on the surface.

This VM is no ordinary one. It‚Äôs got an arcane stack-based architecture, four registers that feel like they've seen better days, and 16KB of memory that‚Äôs probably still running on hopes and dreams. But here‚Äôs the twist: the terminal was built by a paranoid genius who coded a secret message‚Äîhidden deep within the memory‚Äîwrapped in layers of logic more convoluted than the plot of a sci-fi novel.
