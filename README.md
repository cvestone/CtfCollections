Flag format: `ping{.*}`

In the late 13th century, the renowned mathematician name missing lay on his deathbed. Before his passing, he decided to leave a cryptic message on his grave, an enigmatic sequence of numbers. These numbers appeared to be unrelated, lacking the characteristic pattern.

As time went by, mathematicians and scholars puzzled over these seemingly random numbers, attempting to decipher their meaning. It became a mathematical mystery, a challenge to uncover the hidden message left by the brilliant mind of a mysterious person. Despite numerous attempts, the code remained unbroken.

To this day, the numbers on the grave of this mysterious person continue to perplex and intrigue those who come across them, a testament to the enduring legacy of a mathematical genius who left a final puzzle for the world to unravel.

Meet Bajtek, the coding virtuoso at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. After a wild night of celebrating a successful compile, fueled by too much caffene (and probably something stronger) Bajtek awoke with a colossal hangover. The room echoed with the triumphant cheers of his algorithms from the night before, but there was one tiny hiccup‚Äîhe couldn't remember his password.

In the last programming session, Bajtek unleashed a coding catastrophe ‚Äì his spaghetti code was so messy that even the compiler threw up its hands in surrender. Colleagues attempted to debug it, but the code was like a Rubik's Cube on a caffeine overdose. Bajtek proudly declared it an avant-garde programming masterpiece, leaving his coworkers wondering if they should call a programmer's version of an exorcist. In the end, they renamed his file "spaghetti.cpp" to "noodleNightmare.cpp" as a memorial to the chaotic session.

For every move you play, Black gets two! Stockfish plays against you!

Really straight forward, survive 50 moves, you win.

You can get your Italians ready by 1. e2e4 or play Queen's Gambit with 1. d2d4

I played 1. d2d4 then 2. c2c4 then 3. d1d4 and lost my Queen :'(

Good luck to you though!

I'm trying to find a flight I took back in 2012. I forgot the airport and the plane, but I know it is the one with an orange/red logo on the right side of this photo I took. Can you help me identify it?

The flag format is UofTCTF{AIRPORT_AIRLINE_AIRCRAFT}. AIRPORT is the 3 letter IATA code, AIRLINE is the name of the airline (dash-separated if required), and AIRCRAFT is the aircraft model and variant (omit manufacturer name). For example, UofTCTF{YYZ_Air-Canada_A320-200} or UofTCTF{YYZ_Delta_767-300}.

Note: The aircraft variant should be of X00 format; ie. there may be models with XYZ-432, but the accepted variant will be XYZ-400.
